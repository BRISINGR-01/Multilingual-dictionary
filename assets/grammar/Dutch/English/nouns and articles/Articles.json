The differences will be outlined in the use of articles."},{"type":"p","text":"An article always precedes a noun (thing or person). It tells us whether we are dealing with a particular thing or person (definite) or whether we are talking about just any thing or person, or about things or persons in general (indefinite). In English, we have the indefinite article 'a' (or 'an') and the definite article 'the'."},{"type":"p","text":"'A' means roughly the same as 'one'. If we place 'a' before a noun, we are saying that this noun is singular (one)."},{"type":"p","text":"By using 'one', we are stressing the quantity (a single one, merely one), while 'a' is used when the quantity is not relevant."},{"type":"p","text":"'The' is similar to the demonstratives 'this', that, 'these' and 'those'. We use this article when we are referring to a specific thing or person. When we use a demonstrative pronoun, we are not only referring to a specific thing or person, we are also 'pointing' at it."}]}
