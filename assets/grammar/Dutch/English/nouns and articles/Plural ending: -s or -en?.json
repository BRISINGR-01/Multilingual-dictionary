The reason for this is that the last syllable is unstressed. Had it been stressed, as in genie (genius), we would have added -en: genieën.\n[2] In Dutch as it is spoken in Holland, many -but not all- words that end in -aar get the ending -en instead of -s. They do this for words like eigenaren (owners), leraren (teachers), and ambtenaren (civil servants). The Flemmish are more consistent in using the -s ending.\n[3] Several Latin -um nouns can also take -a as the plural ending."}]}
