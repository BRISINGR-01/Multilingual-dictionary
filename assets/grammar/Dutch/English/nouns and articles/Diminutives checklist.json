{"title":"Diminutives checklist","body":[{"type":"p","text":"Those of you who did not and will not read all those diminutive rules can consult the table below to check the diminutive for each noun ending. Nouns that simply take -je are not listed here, which means that if your noun does not have any of the endings listed below, its diminutive will take -je."},{"type":"p","text":"Suppose you want to look up the diminutive for the noun 'bezwaar' (objection). First, you take the last syllable of the word, which is 'zwaar'. Then, drop all the consonants before the vowel(s) and you get 'aar'. Scroll down and you will find that words that end in 'aar' have diminutives ending in 'aartje'. Thus, a small 'bezwaar' is a 'bezwaartje'."},{"type":"table","table":[["A","diminutive ending"],["-a","-aatje"],["-aai","-aaitje"],["-aal","-aaltje"],["-aar","-aartje"],["-aam","-aampje"],["-al","-alletje"],["-alm","-almpje"],["-am","-ammetje"],["-an","-annetje"],["-ang","-angetje"],["-ar","-arretje"],["-arm","-armpje"],["-au","-autje"],["-auw","-auwtje"]]},{"type":"table","table":[["E","diminutive ending"],["-e","-etje"],["-é","-étje"],["-ee","-eetje"],["-eel","-eeltje"],["-eem","-eempje"],["-eer","-eertje"],["-eeuw","-eeuwtje"],["-ei","-eitje"],["-el (unstressed)","-eltje"],["-el (stressed)","-elletje"],["-elm","-elmpje"],["-em (unstressed)","-empje"],["-em (stressed)","-emmetje"],["-en (unstressed)","-entje"],["-en (stressed)","-ennetje"],["-eng","-engetje"],["-er (unstressed)","-ertje"],["-er (stressed)","-erretje"],["-erm","-ermpje"],["-eu","-eutje"],["-eul","-eultje"],["-eum","-eumpje"],["-eun","-euntje"],["-eur","-eurtje"]]},{"type":"table","table":[["I","diminutive ending"],["-i","-ietje"],["-ie","-ietje"],["-iel","-ieltje"],["-iem","-iempje"],["-ien","-ientje"],["-ier","-iertje"],["-ieuw","-ieuwtje"],["-il","-illetje"],["-ilm","-ilmpje"],["-im","-immetje"],["-in","-innetje"],["-ing (unstressed)","-inkje"],["-ing (stressed)","-ingetje"],["-ir","-irretje"],["-irm","-irmpje"]]},{"type":"table","table":[["O","diminutive ending"],["-o","-ootje"],["-oe","-oetje"],["-oei","-oeitje"],["-oel","-oeltje"],["-oem","-oempje"],["-oen","-oentje"],["-oer","-oertje"],["-ol","-olletje"],["-olm","-olmpje"],["-om","-ommetje"],["-on","-onnetje"],["-ong","-ongetje"],["-ooi","-ooitje"],["-ool","-ooltje"],["-oom","-oompje"],["-oon","-oontje"],["-oor","-oortje"],["-or (unstressed)","-ortje"],["-or (stressed)","-orretje"],["-orm","-ormpje"],["-ou","-outje"],["-ouw","-ouwtje"]]},{"type":"table","table":[["U","diminutive ending"],["-u","-uutje"],["-ui","-uitje"],["-ul","-ulletje"],["-ulm","-ulmpje"],["-um (unstressed)","-umpje"],["-um (stressed)","-ummetje"],["-un","-unnetje"],["-ung","-ungetje"],["-ur","-urretje"],["-urm","-urmpje"],["-uul","-uultje"],["-uum","-uumpje"],["-uun","-uuntje"],["-uur","-uurtje"]]},{"type":"table","table":[["Y","diminutive ending"],["-y","-y'tje"]]}]}
