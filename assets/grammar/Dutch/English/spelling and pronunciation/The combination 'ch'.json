If we do not do this, the second syllable starts with ch + another consonant (which will generally make it hard to pronounce)."},{"type":"table","table":[["burchten","burch-ten","castles","not: bur-chten"]]},{"type":"p","text":" burchten"},{"type":"p","text":"The reason why ch is considered to be one consonant is simple. Look what happens if we treat it as two consonants: a word like lachen would be divided as lac-hen. This completely changes the pronunciation of the separate syllables: as in English, the c at the end of a syllable is pronounced as k. We do get another problem, being the length of the vowel but we will get to that later."},{"type":"p","text":"(*) There used to be a difference between the pronunciation of ch and g but nowadays, most Dutch speakers no longer make this distinction.
