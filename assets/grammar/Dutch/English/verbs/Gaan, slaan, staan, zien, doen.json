Although they both end in -en, the letter e is part of a vowel combination, not the usual mute e you find at the end of an infinitive."},{"type":"p","text":"Because oe in doen and ie in zien are vowel combinations, they are each considered as one long vowel. This is the reason why we cannot simply subtract -en."},{"type":"p","text":"So what do we do instead? Very simple: We subtract -n.

And staa and slaa are also wrong. Recall, that a syllable never ends in a double vowel! The stems are thus ga, sla, and sta. In the 2nd and 3rd singular, however, we write double aa again: gaat, slaat, and staat. Because of the additional t, we need a double vowel to keep the sound long."},{"type":"p","text":"Click here to see the conjugations of gaan, slaan and staan."}]}
