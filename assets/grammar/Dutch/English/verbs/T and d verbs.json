To remember them, the Dutch use the words 't kofschip ('the koff boat') or 't fokschaap ('the breeding sheep'), which both contain all of the t-verb consonants. The only consonant that is missing is the letter 'x'. This is not such a problem as there are only very few verb stems that end in -x. A common x-verb is faxen (to fax). For those of you who find it hard to remember 't kofschip or 't fokschaap, I invented a new fish: The \"pocket fish\". This may be easier to remember for English speakers. Perhaps you will find a better one yourself."},{"type":"p","text":"Remember, that you have to look at the last letter of the crude stem to determine whether a verb is a t or a d-verb.
