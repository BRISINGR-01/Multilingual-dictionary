The present is perfectly regular but they have an irregular simple past and past participle. You can view the conjugations of these verbs in the long list of strong verbs."},{"type":"p","text":"The conjugations in the present tense (e.g. we work) are regular, so all rules mentioned in the section about the present tense, apply here."},{"type":"p","text":"To learn the irregular verb conjugations, you need to learn:"},{"type":"p","text":"In Dutch, the past tense only has two forms, one for the singular and one for the plural.

Apart from that, it is also wise to learn the past participles that take 'zijn' by heart. By far most past participles use 'hebben', several can use both (depending on the context) and some only take 'zijn'. See also zijn, hebben and the past participle. In the list of strong verbs, verbs that can take zijn are indicated."},{"type":"p","text":"Among the irregular verbs, we can discern certain patterns. In English, for example, there is a group of verbs with an i-a-u pattern: 'to sing - sang - sung', 'to ring - rang - rung', and a group with an i-ou-ou pattern: 'to find - found - found', 'to bind - bound - bound'. And there are many more such patterns in English irregular verbs. In Dutch, we find the same phenomenon."}]}
