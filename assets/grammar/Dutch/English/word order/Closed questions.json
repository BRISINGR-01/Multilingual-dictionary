{"title":"Closed questions","body":[{"type":"p","text":"Closed questions always start with a verb, the finite verb to more precise. While in English, we usually need an auxiliary verb (to do) to form a proper closed question, in Dutch we can do without. All it requires is inversion of the finite form and a question mark at the end of the sentence:"},{"type":"table","table":[["Jullie staan meestal vroeg op","You usually get up early"],["Staan jullie meestal vroeg op?","Do you usually get up early?"]]},{"type":"p","text":"As you can see, the question is almost identical to the affirmative phrase. The only change is from jullie staan (affirmative) to staan jullie (question)."},{"type":"table","table":[["Arjan is niet op haar verjaardag gekomen","Arjan has not visited her for her birthday"],["Is Arjan niet op haar verjaardag gekomen?","Has Arjan not visited her for her birthday?"]]},{"type":"p","text":"The above sentence is both a question and a negation. You can see that niet is situated between the middle and the right part: op haar verjaardag is a prepositional object, which sits at the beginning of the right part."},{"type":"table","table":[["Er waren geen getuigen van het ongeval","There were no witnesses of the accident"],["Waren er geen getuigen van het ongeval?","Were there no witnesses of the accident?"]]},{"type":"p","text":"Because the subject is non-specific (geen is an indefinite pronoun), we add the little word er. See also extra er at the beginning of a sentence. If we turn this type of sentence into a question, it is er that switches places with the verb, not the subject (geen getuigen)."}]}
